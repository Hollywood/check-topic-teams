# Enforcing Topics and Teams on a Repository

A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that upon new Repository creation will create an issue reminding the repo owner to add the appropriate topics and teams. In the issue, it `cc`s the instance `Admin` team to ensure that this is fulfilled. 

Ideas for future:
  - Create a ticket in their help desk system after a period of time (now that `schedule` is an event) if these requirements are not satisfied.
  - Determine how to check to see if a `Topic` pertaining to a valid internal `project` has been added to the repo.

## Setup

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the bot
npm start
```
